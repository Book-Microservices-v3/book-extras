## The practical case study
The practical case study
All the contents in the book are presented around a practical case study, that evolves each chapter with the introduction of new concepts.

You start with a small monolith, looking at the best design practices, and you learn how Spring Boot works with real examples.

Then, you introduce a second microservice in the system, and study the differences between synchronous and asynchronous communication. That’s how you get to Event-Driven architectures. Once you enter into the world of microservices, you must learn the most important architecture patterns for distributed systems: Gateway, Service Discovery, Load Balancing, Resilience, Scalability, Distributed Tracing, etc.
